### Intentions
My intention behind this bot was to build knowledge in other programming 
languages. The bot might get better as soon as I learn something new in JavaScript.
If there is no new commits or updates to this bot consider it either finished
or abandoned. Feel free to fork the bot.
Or get involved by making new contributions to the bot as it gets developed.
Feel free to open new issues as soon as you are experiencing a bug or want something specific added to the project.

### Installation
* Clone this git repository.
* Copy the sample config files into the configuration folder and edit them to your liking.
* Run 'npm run run' in the cmd/terminal
* The bot should be online now. If you encounter errors, please open an issue if the same error does not already exists in the issues.

### Environment variables
* NODE_ENV => environment (development or production).

###Config files
Config files will be added into the samples folder but at the moment we are working on a efficient solution to save
stuff like the keys and the database connection.
