This is a bot for the text and voice chat software "Discord".
</hr>

### Intentions
My intention behind this bot was to build knowledge in other programming 
languages. The bot might get better as soon as I learn something new in JavaScript.
If there is no new commits or updates to this bot consider it either finished
or abandoned. Feel free to fork the bot and develop it even further if I have abandoned this project.
Or get involved by making new contributions to the bot as it gets developed.
Feel free to open new issues as soon as you are experiencing a bug or want something specific added to the project.
